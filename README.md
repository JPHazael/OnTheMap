# OnTheMap

On the Map enables users to share their location and a link of their choice with their fellow students. The app uses the MapKit framework to display a map with pins for location and pin annotations containing student names. The app also contains a table view populated with student names and links.

The user logs in to the app using their Udacity username and password. After login, the app downloads student locations and links from the Parse API. After viewing the information posted by other students, users can post their own locations and links.
